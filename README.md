This is a variation of Crypto Mining with a twist - You must compete with other miners for a chance to win Treasury SOL.  This is similar to Bitcoin mining, with one major exception, you are not looking for hashes, but rather special types of Prime Numbers.   Prime numbers are impossible to predict so this is akin to generating random hashes.

Every miner must purchase points (units of economy) to play.  Every mining round costs you 10 points.   You are competing with other miners to win largest portion of the Treasury (which can filled by the point buyers). 

If you are spamming (or running a bot), your power-up level goes down to 10% and you can only win 1/10th of the treasury.  If you wait for your miner to "Power-up", you will be able to win 75% of the Treasury.  However, someone else could win significant portion of SOL before you do.  

How are the winners selected?  The miners are given a random combination of numbers, at any point in time if the sum of those numbers is Prime, you win.  If a Prime number ends with 01, we consider it SuperPrime, and you win 100% of the Treasury - but those are very rare.
Miners that find Primes first are awarded both SOL and Points, so if you are good, you can play forever. 

If you run out of points, you can no longer play, and you must purchase more points to continue.  The SOL you spend on points will enter the Treasury for other miners (and yourself) to complete for. 

Yield Pool, will collect 10% on all points purchased and you will be able to redeem your won points by burning them for a portion of the Yield Pool.

The goal of this mini project was to introduce RUST programming for our technical community and to demonstrate performance of Xolana Testnet Blockchain.
