# Prime Miner
Prime Miner is a unique variation of crypto mining where miners compete to win Treasury SOL by finding special types of prime numbers instead of hashes. Every miner buys points to participate, with each mining round costing 10 points. The goal is to find prime numbers, which are unpredictable like random hashes. If you're caught spamming, your power-up level drops to 10%, limiting your winnings to 1/10th of the treasury. However, waiting for your miner to "Power-up" can allow you to win 75% of the treasury, though others might win significant SOL before you. Winners are determined when the sum of given numbers is prime, with a special reward for "SuperPrimes" ending in 01. Successful miners earn both SOL and points, enabling continuous play. If you run out of points, you must buy more to continue, contributing SOL to the Treasury for others to compete for. The Yield Pool collects 10% of all points purchased, redeemable by burning points for a share of the pool. The goal is to introduce RUST programming and demonstrate the Xolana Testnet Blockchain's performance. Check out the leaderboard demo here: http://216.202.227.220:3333/.

## Features

- Check if a number is prime and reward users accordingly.
- Pay for points using SOL.
- Claim lamports based on user’s won points.
- Maintain a leaderboard of users.
